The frameInput prefab in this folder can be used in any scene, provided
there is an avatar in it. The lookup of the avatar is very hard-coded,
as this experiment doesn't need support for avatar prefabs that appear 
different in naming convention.

Key bindings:
'P' key starts/stops an input recording.
'L' key captures a 'screenshot' command in the recording.
